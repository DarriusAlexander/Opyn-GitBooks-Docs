# Insurance Integrations

## Introduction

Buying and selling insurance happens through oTokens which are ERC20 tokens which represent put options. See the [example use case: insurance on Compound](../#example-use-case-1-insurance-on-compound) and the [example use case: insurance on Dai](../#example-use-case-2-insurance-on-dai) to understand how oTokens work as insurance.
