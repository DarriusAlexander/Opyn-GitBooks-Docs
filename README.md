# Getting Started

## Introduction to Convexity

Convexity is a Decentralized Put Options Protocol built on the Ethereum Blockchain. Convexity provides an easy interface to buy and sell put options. 

Put options work as insurance in traditional finance. Convexity allows options sellers to earn premiums on their collateral and options buyers to protect themselves against technical, financial and systemic risks that various DeFi projects face. These risks include hacks, bank runs, a DeFi crisis etc. 

This site will serve as a project overview for Convexity - explaining how it works, how to use it, and how to build on top of it. These docs are actively being worked on and more information will be added on an ongoing basis. 

Please join the \#dev room in the Opyn community [Discord](https://discord.gg/ugAv3SH) server; our team, and members of the community, look forward to helping you build an application on top of Opyn. Your questions help us improve, so please don't hesitate to ask if you can't find what you are looking for here.

## Example Use Case

Consider the case of a Compound User who wants insurance on their Dai locked in Compound. They fear Compound getting hacked or having a bank run. The insurance buyer pays the insurance provider some premium ahead of time to get access to oTokens. An example of an oToken is the ocDai token which protects the holder of the token from Jan 1 2020 to Jan 1 2021 against any technical or financial risks that Compound's cDai faces. In the case of a disaster, the holder of the oToken can turn in their oToken and their cDai and in exchange take the collateral locked in the Convexity Protocol by insurance providers. If there is no disaster, it is strictly worse for the holder of cDai to give up their cDai in exchange for collateral locked on the Convexity protocol, thus the insurance providers earn a premium on their collateral
